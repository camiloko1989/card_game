Card game developed in C#
When user clicks on Bet, 2 random numbers will be assigned, one for User, one for Computer
If all 4 numbers are populated the game finishes and results are displayed
If user clicks on Done the game finishes and results are displayed
If user clicks New Game all cards are reset
If the sum of all cards is less than 10, it is called a Blast
The winner is the one with more points unless:
- Both players get a Blast, then the Computer wins
- There is a draw but no one gets a Blast, then User wins
